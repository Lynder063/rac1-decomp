# Decompilation progress

Tracks per-function status now that real (non-`INCLUDE_ASM`) C has
started. Verify with the SN toolchain build (`docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`):

```
toolchain/sn-prodg-3.01/usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/bin/make.exe -f Makefile.sn
bash tools/build_sn_data.sh
bash rac1.ld.sh
toolchain/sn-prodg-3.01/usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/bin/ee-ld.exe \
    -T build-sn/rac1.ld build-sn/bss_equs.o -o build-sn/rac1.elf
```

Then compare the specific function's bytes against
`baserom/SCES_509.16`'s corresponding section at the function's known
offset (see `tools/check_match.py` for the whole-section version; for a
single function, slice the section at `(func_vram - section_vram)` for
`nonmatching <label>, <size>` bytes, per the `.s` file's own header
comment).

## Status

| Function | Segment | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `func_00112380` | core_text | **close, not exact** | Logic fully understood: `return func_00116F68(arg0, 0, 10);`. Retail has an extra redundant `dsll32`/`dsra32 v0,v0,0` sign-extension pair (8 bytes) before the return this compiler doesn't emit for any variant tried. See "Open toolchain questions" below. |
| `func_00112464` | core_text | **not a real function** | 4 bytes of `0xCDCDCDCD` — alignment padding between `func_001123A8` and `func_00112468` (rounds the latter to an 8-byte boundary), not code. Left as `INCLUDE_ASM`; nothing to decompile. |
| `func_00112468` | core_text | **close, not exact** | Logic fully understood — see the comment on it in `src/core_text.c` for the full C. Blocked on the `sq`/`lq` vs `sd`/`ld` callee-register-save question below, kept as `INCLUDE_ASM` since the byte diff isn't a small fixed offset like `func_00112380`, it cascades through the whole function. |
| everything else in `core_text`/`text` | core_text, text | not started | Still `INCLUDE_ASM` stubs. 1669 functions total. |

## Open toolchain questions

**Callee-saved GPR spill width (`sq`/`lq` vs `sd`/`ld`).** Retail always
spills callee-saved registers (`$ra`, `$s0`-`$s7`) as plain 64-bit
doublewords (`sd`/`ld`). This toolchain (SN ProDG GCC 2.95.3, SN BUILD
v1.36) spills `$ra` the same way but spills `$s0`-`$s7` as full 128-bit
quadwords (`sq`/`lq`) — first showed up in `func_00112468`, and will
affect essentially every non-leaf function that needs a callee-saved
register, i.e. most of the codebase. No `-m` flag found changes it
(tried: `-mno-abicalls`, `-mhalf-pic`, `-fomit-frame-pointer`,
`-msoft-float`, `-mfp32`, `-mlong32`, `-mabi=eabi -mgp64`, `-mcpu=5900`,
`-mlong64`, `-membedded-data`/`-mno-embedded-data`; `-mgp32` ICEs).

Checked all 4 SN ProDG sub-builds AngheloAlf mirrors, to see if a
different one matches retail natively:

| Mirror | Compiler | `$ra` | `$s0`-`$s7` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SN-Systems-ProDG_for_PS2_3.01` (**in use**) | GCC 2.95.3 SN BUILD v1.36 | `sd`/`ld` (matches retail) | `sq`/`lq` |
| `SN-Systems-ProDG_for_PS2_2.0` | GCC 2.95.2 SN BUILD v2.73a | `sq`/`lq` | `sq`/`lq` |
| `sce_ps2_sdk_24`, `ee-gcc295.exe` | GCC 2.95.2 SN BUILD v2.74 | `sq`/`lq` | `sq`/`lq` |
| `sce_ps2_sdk_24`, `ee-gcc2953.exe` | GCC 2.95.3 SN BUILD v1.14 | `sq`/`lq` | `sq`/`lq` |
| retail (target) | ? | `sd`/`ld` | `sd`/`ld` |

v1.36 is already the closest of the four (right on `$ra`), so switching
sub-builds wouldn't help — this needs either a real flag not yet found,
or Insomniac's actual build differs from all four of these in some other
way (a patch, a different `-mcpu`/tuning value, something in how `sq`-
eligible register classing gets decided that isn't exposed as a simple
flag). Worth checking whether the wider PS2 decomp community has already
solved this for another game before spending more time guessing flags
blind.

## Method

1. Read the `.s` disassembly in `asm/nonmatchings/<segment>/func_XXXXXXXX.s`
   (registers are numeric post-`tools/sn_regnames.py` — `$29`=sp, `$31`=ra,
   `$4`-`$7`=a0-a3, `$2`/`$3`=v0/v1, `$16`-`$23`=s0-s7, `$8`-`$15`=t0-t7).
2. Work out the C shape by hand from the MIPS calling convention (args in
   `$4`-`$7`, return in `$2`).
3. Replace the function's `INCLUDE_ASM(...)` line in the relevant
   `src/*.c` with real C. Forward-declare any not-yet-decompiled callee
   (`extern int func_XXXXXXXX(...);`) — its own `INCLUDE_ASM` stub
   elsewhere in the file still provides the actual symbol at link time.
4. Rebuild (`Makefile.sn`) and diff the function's bytes against the
   retail baserom at its exact address (`tools/check_match.py func
   <vram_hex> <size_hex>`, both straight from the `.s` file's own
   `nonmatching <label>, <size>` header). A match means done; a
   near-match is worth recording (see the table above) rather than
   endlessly guessing flags — codegen idioms can be genuinely
   compiler-sub-version-specific, and this project may not have the exact
   sub-version Insomniac used.
   **Once any function's compiled size differs from retail by even one
   instruction, every function after it in that object shifts — a flat
   whole-section comparison past that point is meaningless, not evidence
   of a regression.** Only trust `tools/check_match.py section` before
   any function in that object has drifted; after that, check functions
   individually by address.
5. Once matching, the readability pass (real names/types/structure) can
   proceed on that function using the still-matching build as a
   regression check, per the plan in `README.md`.
