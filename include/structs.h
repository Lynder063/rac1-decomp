/*
 * Recovered struct layouts.
 *
 * These exist to retire the wall of `*(int *)(s + 0x174)` in src/, which
 * is the long-term goal for this project. They are held to one hard
 * rule: **introducing a struct must not change a single byte**. Field
 * access through a correctly-laid-out struct compiles identically to the
 * offset arithmetic it replaces, so every conversion is verified with
 * tools/sweep_matches.py and reverted if the count moves.
 *
 * Fields are named only where their purpose is actually established.
 * `unkNN` is deliberate: a wrong name is worse than no name, and this
 * file is read as documentation.

/*
 * Node at +0x1E4 of a larger object. Ghidra's caller cross-reference is
 * what identified the embedding: func_00113A70(parent + 0x1E4, 4, 0,
 * parent), i.e. it is constructed in place and handed a back-pointer to
 * its parent, which is what `owner` holds.
 *
 * The four function pointers at 0x20..0x2C are installed together by
 * that same constructor and always with the same four routines, so this
 * is a fixed dispatch block rather than a per-instance vtable.
 *
 * The dispatch routines themselves (func_001162B8, func_001163A0) fill
 * in the rest: they pass `owner` and `handle` down to the layer below,
 * accumulate into `pos`, and set/clear bit 0x1000 of `flags` to mark
 * whether that call succeeded. Note 0x1C and 0x54 are different things
 * -- 0x1C is a pointer to the node itself, 0x54 is the parent -- which
 * is only visible once the constructor and a dispatch routine are read
 * together.

 * Object handled by the func_0023Cxxx family. Recovered by reading the
 * family together rather than one function at a time: the constructor
 * (func_0023C0E0) shows which fields are cleared, func_0023C088 shows
 * which are handed to the layer below, and func_0023C2B0/func_0023C2C0
 * show which are tested.
 *
 * Only `state` is named. It is set to 0 by the constructor, set to 2
 * after the submit in func_0023C088, and tested non-zero before
 * teardown in func_0023C2C0 -- that is enough to call it a state. The
 * rest keep unkNN: 0x4C is rounded down to a 0x400 multiple and 0x50 is
 * compared against 0x1000, which hints at a buffer size and a fill
 * level, but hinting is not knowing and a wrong name here would

 * A 3-element array at +0x1B8 of some parent object, stride 0x10.
 *
 * The stride is not a guess from one function: func_0012BBF8 walks
 * +0x1B8/+0x1C8/+0x1D8 and then +0x1BC/+0x1CC/+0x1DC (the +0x00 and
 * +0x04 fields, column-major), while the banked decode of func_00129600
 * independently uses +0x1B8/+0x1C4, +0x1C8/+0x1D4, +0x1D8/+0x1E4 -- the
 * +0x00 and +0x0C fields of the same three bases. Two unrelated
 * functions agreeing on the same 0x10 grid is what makes this a real
 * layout rather than a pattern in one function's offsets.
 *
 * Nothing is named. unk00 and unk04 are pointers to objects that have
 * something at their own +0x28 (func_0012BBF8 zeroes it). unk0C is
 * chosen *instead of* unk00 in func_00129600 depending on a mode field,
 * so it is probably a pointer of the same kind -- "probably" is why it
 * keeps its unk name. unk08 is never touched by anything decompiled so
 * far and is a placeholder holding the stride, not an observed field.
 *
 * Note the array runs 0x1B8..0x1E8, so its last element covers 0x1E4.
 * That is NOT the Node1E4 above: a different parent object happens to
 * have a node at the same offset. Do not conflate them.

 * The object a wrapper holds at its +0x40, and the owner of the Slot1B8
 * array above.
 *
 * The identification is by call site, not by pattern-matching offsets:
 * func_0012C200 computes `inner = *(p + 0x40)` and then calls
 * func_0012C278(inner) directly, which is what proves func_0012C278's
 * argument is this object and not the wrapper. func_00129C78 shares the
 * 0x08/0xAC/0x118 field set with it, so it takes this object too.
 *
 * Nothing here is named -- the field roles are not established yet.
 * unk118 and unk0AC are subtracted from each other in func_0012C200 to
 * produce the wrapper's 0x08, and unk008 is compared against 2 as a
 * state, but that is suggestive rather than settled.
 *
 * SIZE IS NOT KNOWN. The trailing padding runs to 0x820 only because
 * that is the highest field anything decompiled so far touches
 * (func_00129C78), so sizeof(Obj40) is a floor, not the real size. Do
 * not embed this by value, allocate it, or index an array of it -- it is
 * only ever used through a pointer to memory the game already owns.
