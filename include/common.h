/*
 * Keeps a variable OUT of the small-data area.
 *
 * Retail addresses some globals via $gp (the MIPS small-data area, base
 * 0x00166D00 from its own .reginfo, window 0x15ED00..0x16ED00). To
 * reproduce those we must build with a nonzero -G, but that makes the
 * compiler use $gp for EVERY small global -- including the ~60 that live
 * far outside the window, whose references then can't reach
 * ("relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GPREL16").
 *
 * Placement is decided per variable by its declared size, but the
 * incomplete-array trick (`extern char x[];`) changes how the variable
 * must be spelled at every use site, which is unacceptable for scalars
 * inside already-matching functions. An explicit section attribute
 * achieves the same thing while leaving use sites untouched: the
 * compiler knows the variable isn't in .sdata and falls back to lui/lo.
 *
 * Verified directly: a plain `extern unsigned char x;` compiles to
 * `lbu $v0,0($gp)` at -G8, the same declaration with this macro compiles
 * to `lui`/`lbu`. (`aligned` does NOT work -- it stays gp-relative.)
